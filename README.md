Licensing
=========

While these simple utilities can be used by anyone in the public domain at their own risk,
the IBM products for which they are designed (ILMT, CIT) are owned by IBM. While TAD4D is a 
commercial version, ILMT and CIT are currently free (as in 'free beer') to any IBM customer
and are designed to help IBM customers meet their licensing audit goals. The spirit of these
utilities is the same, to help IBM customers meet these same goals, but you accept full
responsibility for using them.
